Day 4 Overview (6/4/2020)
Worked on Neurotech Week 5 Assignment - MATLAB
- Coded in conjunction to the video from part 2 of assignment to learn how to use classificationLearner
	For more detail about this, see the pdf of the assignment
-Explored model predictors, scatter plots, features, parameters, confusion matrices, and ROC curves in classificationLearner
	model predictors - variables/ features you can put in the left side of the classificationLearner window to predict a scatter plot
	features - mean, std, pca etc of your data over a time frame
	parameters - can tweak these for different classifiers to create more accurate models
	confusion matrices - show true positives, true negatives, false positives, false negatives in a table - help see how good your model is
	ROC curves - these look like plateaus and are useful in understanding how good your model is - this is a bit more advanced ML, so haven't explored this a lot
