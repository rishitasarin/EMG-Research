**Please note, I took 06/15/2020 and 06/16/2020 off to understand the potential pathways for Fall 2020 and what they mean for me as a student.**

Day 10 Overview (6/17/2020)
-Wrote cases for all the features investigated in Day 8/9. 
-Began implementation of cases in ClassificationLearner. Please refer to classification_prelim_results.jpg files to see the results.
	I implemented only features from the "signal amplitude and power feature group."
	My highest accuracy rate is 90.9% when I have 2 features selected. This accuracy % remains the same till 22/24 features are selected. When 23/24 or 24/24 features are selected, accuracy % begins to decrease.
		It seems like this is because we are essentially trying out features which have the same function even though the math may look slightly different on the surface level.
-Asked Team about L-Scale, DFA, and MFL - they are still working on these features. Will explain, once they understand them.
