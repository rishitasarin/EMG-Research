Day 12 Overview (6/19/2020)
-svm as the classifier
-loop through different cases for different features

Day 13 Overview (6/23/2020)
-continued to work on code for feature extraction of same feature from both channels

Day 14 Overview (6/24/2020)
- % accuracy of permutations of features - Check out classification_loop.mlx
	highest accuracy + validation accuracy
	highest + second highest accuracy + validation accuracy of these 2 together
	etc.

-need to go back and comment out this code
-removed dvarv + mmav1 due to naming issues - need to go back to this

- Issues to discuss
	can't form vector of feat names + validation accuracy because feat names keep expanding
	removed msr + ld - kept getting complex data values - recheck formula
