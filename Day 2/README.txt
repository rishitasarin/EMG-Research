Day 2 Overview (6/2/2020)
Worked on Neurotech Week 10 Assignment (Option A with Sam's Data)
- Followed Kramer&Eden-NeuralAnalysisDraft.pdf (Chapter 2 of a neuro textbook) to write MATLAB Code

	1. Plotted Trial 1 Data from both channels (Zygomaticus Major and Corrugator Supercilii)
	2. Plotted all Trials for Ch1 (ZM), then Ch2 (CS) in an Image Scan (Super Pretty Pictures!) - saw overarching trends in all trials; can point out outliers
	3. Calculated + Plotted ERP of Ch1, then Ch2 (evoked response potential) which shows mean voltage of all trials at each moment in time
	4. Compared difference in ERP of Ch1 and Ch2 to see where the 2 channel voltages were similar and where they were different
	5. 95% Confidence Interval tells you that 95% of the population mean exists between these certain values - Upper CI and Lower CI
		a. CLT - mean of sufficiently large # of ind. random variables (each with finite mean + variance) will be approx. normally distributed - bell curve
		b. Bootstrapping - requires few assumptions than CLT about data set, resample the data (with replacement)...
